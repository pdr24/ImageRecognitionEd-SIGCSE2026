# On Teaching Image Recognition to Children at a Summer Camp - ACM SIGCSE TS 2026
Authors: Pragathi Durga Rajarajan, Dr. Fred Martin

University of Texas at San Antonio - Engaging Computing Group

## About
A module on image recognition was developed and delivered by Pragathi Durga Rajarajan as part of the University of Texas at San Antonio's AI for Everyone summer camp, under the guidance of Dr. Fred Martin. A full paper will be published at the ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE TS 2026).

The module includes an unplugged activity and AI-See, a novel software activity for teaching feature maps and kernel math to middle school students (grades 6-8).
